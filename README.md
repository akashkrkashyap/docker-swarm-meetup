# Docker Swarm Workshop

## About this exercise set

> To help the users of this exercise to learn how to use docker and where to get help when they are stuck in the real world, I have tried to create exercieses that forces the user to look in documentation and experiment.
> **This means, that the excercise set is not a simple copy & paste exercise**

Now get started with the [Docker Swarm Exercises](Docker_Swarm_Exercises.md)

## I need more help - please

If you are stuck in the exercises there is a branch called _"i\_need\_to\_cheat"_.
This branch contains the solutions for most of the exercises.
